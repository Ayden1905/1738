        <h1>Cafes and resturants in Australia</h1>
        <p>Cafes in Melbourne are very popular both with citizens and tourists, 
            because of the fact that Australias coffee standard and quality is leagues above
            other countries, leading to many cafes in Australia. Resturants, on the other hand benefit
            from Melbourne's multi-cultural population, leading to a diverse arrangment of resturants and food.
            The following visualisations aim to explore the locations of resturants and cafes in Melbourne, their seating capacity and much more.</p>

          <h2>Seating Capacity of cafes and resturants in Melbourne</h2>
          <p>Unfortunately despite the large number of cafes within Melbourne, many are turning towards a more takeaway experience,
          where you order a coffee and leave, instead of sitting down in the cafe. Likewise, many resturants are leaning towards this apporach as well,
          encouraging take-away rather than eating in. Looking at the bar chart, it can be seen that CBD(Centeral Business District) dominates compared to other suburbs,
          holding the lead for most cafes regardless of the year, which is not surprising and expected. Docklands follows in second place, and in third comes
          Southbank, all of which are major hubs for Melbournians.</p>
